# Sling

Welcome to the past. This is an ancient customer support webapp built for use with [Three Rings]
games. The original webapp was called Underwire (it provides support), but at some point someone
decided to rewrite it all and called it Sling, to be slightly less juvenile.

It's still actually used by operating games (now run by [Grey Havens] who are looking after said
games into their senescence) which is why it's out here on Github so that we can ship releases of
it to Maven Central and whatnot.

Unless you're some kind of archaeologist, you probably want to move it along.
